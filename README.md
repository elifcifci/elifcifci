### Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Elif Cifci. My psychological counselor, but with the passion to produce, I took the step in December 2021 for the career change that I have been planning since 2017. I took the first step to the software with java. I started the computer programming associate degree program in 2020. As of December 2021, I have been improving myself in the frontend field at Patika.
